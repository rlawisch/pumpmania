# This file is UTF-8; to be readable, edit it in an editor capable

# Also it's best to view this with a font that supports various UTF-8

#
# Six keywords: TitleFrom, ArtistFrom, SubtitleFrom, TitleTo,
# ArtistTo, SubtitleTo.
#
# From lines are regular expressions.  If all From lines for a set
# are matched, all To lines are replaced.
#
# All lines, by default, must match the entire line; for example,
# "Foo" matches only "Foo", not "Foobar".  Matches are case-insensitive.
#
# Matches are checked in the order given in this file; more than one
# set may match a single song.
#
# Courses are matched by title only.
#
# Note that changes to this file are only applied to songs when they are
# first loaded.  Delete the files in the "Cache" directory after making
# changes.
